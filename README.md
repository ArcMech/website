# Django + React.js webpage.

In this repository you can find all code I used for my page/blog. It contains React.js as a frontend and Django with DRF as backend. Frontend for page was published earlier on [my github here](https://github.com/ArcMech/blog-frontend).

Features I'm working currently on:
- [ ] portfolio subpage
- [ ] dev-week updates subblog
- [ ] contact-form 
- [ ] comment section underneath posts
- [ ] redux
